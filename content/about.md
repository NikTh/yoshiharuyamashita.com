## About me

Hello!

My name is Yoshiharu Yamashita, Yoshi for short.

I'm originally from Japan but came to England to study all those years ago. I've been in this country for almost 15 years. Time flies! I ended up in Bristol, UK because of my first job.

### Software Engineer

That's my main job. I currently work on software tools to automatically check and correct video/audio problems in file-based media. In my role, I mainly code in C++ but I often get to use C#, JavaScript and Python as well, which I like.

### Freelance Translator

I also carry out English to Japanese translations and proofreading for computer related areas, including

- GUIs
- Technical user guides, website contents
- Voice over for video tutorials

It's good to combine my language skills with computing.

### Wannabe Freestyle Footballer

I keep a football in my office and practice at lunch time. My current favourite place to practice is the alley at the back of my office off which there are several pubs. The surface is uneven and made of cobbles but I like it there because it's very quiet at lunch time.
