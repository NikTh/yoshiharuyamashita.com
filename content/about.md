## About me

I'm originally from Japan but came to England to study all those years ago. I've been in this country for almost 15 years. Time flies! I ended up in Bristol because of my first job.

### Software Engineer

That's my main job. I work on software tools to automatically check and correct video/audio problems in file-based media. In my role, I mainly code in C++ but I often get to use C#, JavaScript and Python as well, which I like. 

### Freelance Translator

Not so frequently these days but I also carry out English to Japanese translations and proofreading when asked (mainly computing related stuff, including GUIs, user guides etc). It's good to combine my language skills with computing.

### Wannabe Freestyle Footballer

I keep a football in my office and practice at lunch time. My current favourite place to practice is the alley at the back of my office off which there are several pubs. The surface is uneven and made of cobbles but I like it there because it's very quiet at lunch time.
