      <title>Visiting Colston Hall Record Fair 2016</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have missed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.colstonhallrecordfair.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Colston Hall Record Fair&lt;/a&gt; three times already this year so we were glad to finally be able to take a look this weekend. It is the biggest record fair in the South West and definitely worth a visit!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;pure-u-1-1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;pure-img&#34; src=&#34;http://yoshiharuyamashita.com/img/post/colston-hall-record-fair-2016-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Colston Hall Record Fair 2016&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you walk into the building you will notice how airy and open &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.colstonhall.org/&#34;&gt;Colston Hall&lt;/a&gt; is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was pleasant and almost therapeutic to walk around the foyer watching and listening to people browsing and discussing records.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;pure-u-1-1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;pure-img&#34; src=&#34;http://yoshiharuyamashita.com/img/post/colston-hall-record-fair-2016-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Colston Hall Record Fair 2016&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Thankfully (not for the traders of course) the fair was not as crowded as we anticipated. It was probably because we visited at 3pm (the event closes at 4pm) and also due to the bad weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the event had a relaxing and calm atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;pure-u-1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;pure-img&#34; src=&#34;http://yoshiharuyamashita.com/img/post/colston-hall-record-fair-2016-3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Colston Hall Record Fair 2016&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I know it probably sounds silly but there were such a LOT of records being sold spread over three floors. Although each box is well labelled with artist names or music genres, for us record fair beginners it was rather overwhelming. It must be vinyl heaven for the experienced enthusiast but we were not quite prepared this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;pure-u-1-3&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;pure-u-1-3&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;pure-img&#34; src=&#34;http://yoshiharuyamashita.com/img/post/colston-hall-record-fair-2016-4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Colston Hall Record Fair 2016&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;pure-u-1-3&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;pure-img&#34; src=&#34;http://yoshiharuyamashita.com/img/post/colston-hall-record-fair-2016-5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Colston Hall Record Fair 2016&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;pure-u-1-3&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;pure-img&#34; src=&#34;http://yoshiharuyamashita.com/img/post/colston-hall-record-fair-2016-6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Colston Hall Record Fair 2016&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next record fair is on &lt;strong&gt;5th November 2016&lt;/strong&gt; so be sure to check it out if you are in the area. We have already decided to give it another go. Perhaps next time we will decide what genre or artists to look for beforehand so that we do not feel quite so over-faced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; and one final thing, there is a bar/kitchen on the lower ground floor in case you need a break. There is also &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beerdcolston.com/&#34;&gt;Beerd&lt;/a&gt; higher up in the building should you fancy some craft beer and/or pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&#34;http://yoshiharuyamashita.com/post/first-turntable-system/&#34;&gt;ordered our turntable system&lt;/a&gt; at the end of March and it is finally here!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;pure-u-1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;pure-img&#34; src=&#34;http://yoshiharuyamashita.com/img/post/rega-rp1-turntable.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Rega RP1 Turntable&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first record we ever played on our turntable was Moseley Shoals by Ocean Colour Scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our record collection is growing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Checking out Rise Bristol on Record Store Day 2016</title>
      <link>http://yoshiharuyamashita.com/post/checking-out-rise-bristol-on-record-store-day-2016/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2016 09:08:14 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://yoshiharuyamashita.com/post/checking-out-rise-bristol-on-record-store-day-2016/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;On an unseasonably chilly mid-April morning, my missus and I went to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rise-music.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Rise&lt;/a&gt; in Bristol to experience &lt;a href=&#34;http://recordstoreday.co.uk/home/&#34;&gt;Record Store Day&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;queuing-up-is-part-of-the-fun:edd8f465df994f9c038da684c17d5666&#34;&gt;Queuing up is Part of the Fun?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read somewhere that some vinyl fans would start queuing up really early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we are not that dedicated (yet), we got there at about 11am and guess what? There was a long queue. The record section is upstairs and there were staff controlling access to the floor above. Live music was performed at the ground floor where the cafe (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.friskafood.com/&#34;&gt;Friska&lt;/a&gt;) is.  This should have made the queuing up less boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the queue was not moving much. Feeling peckish we decided to come back after having lunch. As we left the store, one of the exclusive vinyl releases in the shop window caught my eye. It was &lt;strong&gt;Moseley Shoals - Ocean Colour Scene&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be the one I would buy had I the choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;second-attempt:edd8f465df994f9c038da684c17d5666&#34;&gt;Second Attempt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we came back to the store for the second time there was no queue nor any staff controlling entrance to the first floor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first floor was full of people and a DJ was playing a collection of music on impressive looking record decks. The atomosphere was very pleasant with good sound quality music. we could really see how popular the event was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;our-first-record-purchases-ever:edd8f465df994f9c038da684c17d5666&#34;&gt;Our First Record Purchases Ever&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Browsing the floor, my missus picked up this one:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;pure-u-1-2&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;pure-img&#34; src=&#34;http://yoshiharuyamashita.com/img/post/jimi-hendrix-smash-hits.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Jimi Hendrix - Smash Hits&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Format: Standard 12&amp;rdquo; Black LP Vinyl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Label: Sony CMG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More Info: Limited to 5000 copies. Restored from original 1969 format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a while but I was happy to find what I was after in the end:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;pure-u-1-2&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;pure-img&#34; src=&#34;http://yoshiharuyamashita.com/img/post/ocean-colour-scene-moseley-shoals.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ocean Colour Scene - Moseley Shoals&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Format: 2LP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Label: UMC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More Info: 20th anniversary edition on red vinyl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was whopping Â£35 though!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not planning to spend that much for a record but I would hate regretting not buying it. So I went ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;overall:edd8f465df994f9c038da684c17d5666&#34;&gt;Overall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was a fun day being part of the event, flipping through records amongst enthusiastic fans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some Record Store Day releases were very pricey perhaps due to their limited availability. Good job the event is held only once a year :p&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The official website lists all the exclusive releases in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://recordstoreday.co.uk/media/2711/product-listing-6apr.pdf&#34;&gt;PDF file&lt;/a&gt; but no price information is included. It would not be too much to ask to include it in the list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all this I have to admit that our record player has still not been delivered yet so we cannot listen to the records. For now all we can do is to admire what we have bought and wait patiently&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Turntable System</title>
      <link>http://yoshiharuyamashita.com/post/first-turntable-system/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2016 06:34:36 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I have been wanting to purchase a turntable system for quite some time. 2016 is our 10th year wedding anniversary and to mark the occasion, we have decided to buy our first turntable system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ideal-system:b41a4348af61d40177eae456f76fa702&#34;&gt;Ideal System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being Japanese living in the UK, my ideal system would be made up of components made in the UK or Japan or by a UK or Japanese audio equipment manufacturer (without breaking the bank of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a beginner in the world of Hi-Fi equipment but have spent a few days doing research based on this criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;turntable:b41a4348af61d40177eae456f76fa702&#34;&gt;Turntable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly came across &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rega.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Rega Research&lt;/a&gt;, which is based in the UK. I also found out about a Glasgow based company called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linn.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Linn Products&lt;/a&gt; but I thought it best to save Linn for when I have bought my country manor house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;amplifier:b41a4348af61d40177eae456f76fa702&#34;&gt;Amplifier&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already had a few Japanese manufacturers in mind. While reading up on Rega turntables, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uk.onkyo.com/en/&#34;&gt;Onkyo&lt;/a&gt; caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;speakers:b41a4348af61d40177eae456f76fa702&#34;&gt;Speakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found choosing a pair of decent but affordable speakers the most difficult part of putting together a turntable system. Initially I ignored my criteria and settled on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dali-speakers.com/&#34;&gt;DALI&lt;/a&gt;, a Danish manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;audio-t:b41a4348af61d40177eae456f76fa702&#34;&gt;Audio T&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being beginners we wanted to speak to Hi-Fi experts from our local shop and buy there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We paid our local Hi-Fi retailer, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.audiot.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Audio T&lt;/a&gt; a visit. By speaking to a very knowledgeable sales person we learnt a number of things such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a good idea to put a blob of blutack under the speakers if you are not using speaker stands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The merits of different cable types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are strangly named components, for example banana plugs and speakers called squawkers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proper way to clean records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would have been more difficult to find out about these things if we bought online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;finally:b41a4348af61d40177eae456f76fa702&#34;&gt;Finally&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of the components we have ordered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rega-RP1-Turntable-Performance-Pack-Grey/dp/B0083I5BYQ&#34;&gt;Rega RP1 Turntable with Performance Pack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Onkyo-A-9010-A9010-Amplifier-Black/dp/B00XPT9T7I/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1459155198&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=onkyo+A9010&#34;&gt;Onkyo A9010 Amplifier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Acoustics-3020-Bookshelf-Speakers-Graphite/dp/B00TR7I1EY/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1459155228&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=Q+Acoustics+3020&#34;&gt;Q Acoustics 3020 Bookshelf Speakers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01A2JF2J2?psc=1&#34;&gt;Chord Company C-Screen Speaker Cable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 BFA Z Plugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PRJ-BRUSHIT Carbon-Fibre Brush&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system is not ready yet so in the meantime we are going to buy some records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a fun bank holiday and it has been sunny for once!  I am looking forward to spending the next one listening to our first turntable system.&lt;/p&gt;
